```

### **3. Conversational Interface**
```javascript
// Chat with your AI agent
user: "Why did you move my money?"
ai: "I noticed Ethereum gas fees spiked to $50 per transaction, so I moved your USDC to Polygon where you're earning the same 8% APY but with $0.01 fees instead. Saved you $200 this month! üí∞"

user: "Should I buy more ETH?"
ai: "Based on your risk profile, you're already at your 30% crypto allocation limit. But I found a way to get ETH exposure through liquid staking at 5% APY if you want to DCA in slowly? ü§î"
```
