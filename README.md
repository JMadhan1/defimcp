- **AI Integration**: Comput3 AI API with LLaMA models
- **Protocol Compliance**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 responsive design
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn on Replit infrastructure

### 🔧 DeFi Protocols Supported
- **DEX Operations**: Uniswap V2/V3, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Raydium, Orca
- **Lending**: Aave V3, Compound V3, Solend
- **Yield Farming**: Liquidity provision and reward farming
- **Staking**: Liquid staking through Lido

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd onedefi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (handled automatically by Replit):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (see Environment Variables section)

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` and be accessible via Replit's web interface.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set the following environment variables:

```env
# Required for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_comput3_api_key_here

# Blockchain RPC URLs (optional - uses public RPCs by default)
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://cloudflare-eth.com
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

# Development settings
USE_TESTNET=true
DEBUG=true

# Flask settings
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Note**: For AI features to work, you'll need a Comput3 API key. Set it in the Replit Secrets tab as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## 📖 Usage Example

### 1. Web Interface
Navigate to your Replit URL to access the web interface:
- **Dashboard**: Portfolio overview and analytics
- **AI Features**: Access Portfolio Doctor, Strategy Sommelier, and Chat Assistant
- **API Docs**: Complete API documentation

### 2. MCP Protocol Usage
```python
import requests

# Analyze portfolio
response = requests.post("https://your-repl-url/mcp", json={
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "defi.portfolio",
    "params": {
        "wallet_address": "0x742d35Cc6641C88c4f95bbCdDB96a2b0f0f3f6b7f",
        "blockchain": "ethereum"
    },
    "id": 1
})
```

### 3. AI Features Usage
```python
# Portfolio health check
response = requests.post("https://your-repl-url/api/v1/ai/portfolio-checkup", json={
    "wallet_address": "0x742d35Cc6641C88c4f95bbCdDB96a2b0f0f3f6b7f",
    "blockchain": "ethereum"
})

# Create investment strategy
response = requests.post("https://your-repl-url/api/v1/ai/create-strategy", json={
    "goals": "I want steady 8% returns with low risk",
    "wallet_address": "0x742d35Cc6641C88c4f95bbCdDB96a2b0f0f3f6b7f"
})
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Icon Warnings**: Feather icons 'wallet' and 'brain' are not valid - these are cosmetic warnings that don't affect functionality
2. **Testnet Mode**: Currently runs in testnet mode for safety - set `USE_TESTNET=false` for mainnet operations
3. **Rate Limits**: Public RPC endpoints have rate limits - consider using premium RPC providers for production
4. **AI Dependencies**: Some AI features require internet connectivity to Comput3 API
